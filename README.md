# HARADA — Structured Goal Setting App 🎯

This project explores how to bring the Harada Method of goal setting into a simple, digital workflow.  
The aim is to create a clean and disciplined interface that supports daily habits, long-term goals, and structured self-management.

This repo is part of my hands-on exploration of vibe coding, lightweight app design, and personal productivity systems.

## 🧩 What the Harada App Will Enable

- Define one primary long-term goal  
- Break it into measurable sub-goals  
- Set daily tasks aligned with the goal  
- Track progress with simple visual feedback  
- Maintain consistency through structured routines  

---

## 🎯 Why This Project

The Harada Method is widely used for high-performance self-management.  
This app helps translate that framework into a practical digital tool, combining:

- Structured thinking  
- Behavior design  
- Lightweight UX  
- Simple data storage  
- AI-assisted development workflows  

---

## 🛠️ Planned Tech Stack

- Python  
- Flask (simple, clean web UI)  
- SQLite for data persistence  
- Modular templates + routes  
- Optional LLM-powered guidance (future)

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap (High-Level)

- [ ] Define core Harada data model  
- [ ] Build basic goal-setting flows  
- [ ] Add daily-check-in workflow  
- [ ] Add streaks & progress display  
- [ ] Optional: AI guidance for goals & planning  
- [ ] Polish UI & deploy a lightweight version

The app will be built incrementally, following the same vibe-coding approach used in my other projects.
